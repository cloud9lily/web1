    <p>There is archaeological debate regarding precisely where Dublin was established by the Gaels in or before the 7th century AD.
    <br>Later expanded as a Viking settlement, the Kingdom of Dublin, the city became Ireland's principal settlement following the Norman invasion.
    <br>The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second largest city in the British Empire before the Acts of Union in 1800.
